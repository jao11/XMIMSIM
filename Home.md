XMI-MSIM is an open source tool designed for predicting the spectral response of energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometers using Monte-Carlo simulations.
It comes with a fully functional graphical user interface in order to make it as user friendly as possible.
Considerable effort has been taken to ensure easy installation on all major platforms.

Development of this package was part of my PhD thesis. The algorithms were inspired by the work of my promotor Prof. Laszlo Vincze of Ghent University. Links to his and my own publications can be found in this manual.

A manuscript has been published in [Spectrochimica Acta Part B](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sab.2012.03.011) that covers the algorithms that power XMI-MSIM. Please include a reference to this publication in your own work if you decide to use XMI-MSIM for academic purposes.

A second manuscript was [published](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sab.2012.12.011) that covers our XMI-MSIM based quantification plug-in for [PyMca](http://pymca.sourceforge.net). Soon information on using this plug-in will be added to the manual.

XMI-MSIM is released under the terms of the [GPLv3](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).

**A [workshop](http://www.esrf.eu/home/events/conferences/monte-carlo-simulation-tools-for-x-ray-imaging-and-fluorescence.html) on Monte Carlo simulation tools for X-ray imaging and fluorescence is being organized on February 24 and 25 at the ESRF (Grenoble, France) that includes tutorial sessions on [xraylib](http://github.com/tschoonj/xraylib), [XMI-MSIM](http://github.com/tschoonj/xmimsim) and [XRMC](http://github.com/golosio/xrmc).**
