h1. Welcome to the xmimsim wiki!

h2. Introduction

XMI-MSIM is an open source tool designed for the Monte Carlo based simulation energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometers.
For now information is limited but it will updated soon...
I've added a poster that I presented recently at the ICXOM2011 conference with some information on the underlying algorithms and some results.
A file with installation instructions is also added.

A manuscript has been submitted to Spectrochimica Acta Part B covering the algorithms.

Keep in mind that XMI-MSIM is released under the GPL.

h2. Installation instructions

All dependencies should be easy to obtain, except for FGSL which is available from the Download section as well. Do not use the "official version":http://www.lrz.de/services/software/mathematik/gsl/fortran , it won't work when used in combination with xmimsim.

"xraylib":http://github.com/tschoonj/xraylib can be obtained at my repository...

h3. Linux

To facilitate the installation on linux systems, the package includes a spec file which can be used to produce RPM packages for linux distributions that support them (Fedora, Red Hat, Ubuntu etc). The developers have built 64-bit RPM packages of __xmimsim__ for the Fedora 16 and Redhat EL/CentOS/Scientific Linux 6 distributions. These can be downloaded from the RPM repository that is hosted by the X-ray Microspectroscopy and Imaging research group of Ghent University. Access to this repository can be obtained as follows for Fedora distros:

bq. @su -c 'rpm -Uvh http://lvserver.ugent.be/yum/xmi-repo-key-fedora.noarch.rpm'@

and for Red Hat EL based distributions:

bq. @su -c 'rpm -Uvh http://lvserver.ugent.be/yum/xmi-repo-key-redhat.noarch.rpm'@

The __xmimsim__ packages themselves can then be downloaded using yum:

bq. @su -c 'yum install xmimsim'@

Updates can be installed in a similar way:

bq. @su -c 'yum update xmimsim'@

h3. Windows

An installer containing the 32-bit binaries of __xmimsim__ for the Windows platform can be found in the Downloads section. 

h3. Mac OS X

For now, the source code must be compiled by the user. I plan on adding it to MacPorts soon...
