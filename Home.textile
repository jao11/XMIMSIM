XMI-MSIM is an open source tool designed for the Monte Carlo based simulation energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometers.

I've added a poster that I presented at the ICXOM2011 conference with some information on the underlying algorithms and some results.
A pdf of an oral presentation I gave at the EXRS2012 conference can also be found in the Downloads section.
A file with installation instructions is also added.

A manuscript has been accepted for publication in "Spectrochimica Acta Part B":http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sab.2012.03.011 covering the algorithms. Please include a reference to this publication in your own work if you decide to use XMI-MSIM for academic purposes.

A second manuscript was "published":http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sab.2012.12.011 that covers our XMI-MSIM based quantification plug-in for "PyMca":http://pymca.sourceforge.net.

Keep in mind that XMI-MSIM is released under the terms of the "GPLv3":http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html
