h1. Welcome to the xmimsim wiki!

h2. Introduction

xmimsim is an open source tool designed for the Monte Carlo based simulation energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometers.
For now information will be limited but it will updated soon...
I've added a poster that I presented recently at the ICXOM2011 conference with some information on the underlying algorithms and some results.
A file with installation instructions is also added.

A manuscript has been submitted to Spectrochimica Acta Part B covering the algorithms.

Keep in mind that xmimsim is released under the GPL
