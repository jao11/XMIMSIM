h1. Welcome to the xmimsim wiki!

h2. Introduction

XMI-MSIM is an open source tool designed for the Monte Carlo based simulation energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometers.
For now information is limited but it will updated soon...
I've added a poster that I presented recently at the ICXOM2011 conference with some information on the underlying algorithms and some results.
A file with installation instructions is also added.

All dependencies should be easy to obtain, except for FGSL which is available from the Download section as well. Do not use the "official version":http://www.lrz.de/services/software/mathematik/gsl/fortran , it won't work when used combined with xmimsim.


"xraylib":http://github.com/tschoonj/xraylib can be obtained at my repository...




A manuscript has been submitted to Spectrochimica Acta Part B covering the algorithms.

Keep in mind that XMI-MSIM is released under the GPL.
