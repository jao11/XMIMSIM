On this page a short manual is presented that should allow users to get started with XMI-MSIM. Although the screenshots were obtained on a Mac, they should be representative for Windows and Linux as well. Significant divergences will be indicated.
The following guide assumes that the user has already installed XMI-MSIM, according to the [Installation instructions](../wiki/Installation-instructions).

## <a id="launch"></a>Launching XMI-MSIM

For Mac users: assuming you dragged the app into the Applications folder, use Finder or Spotlight to launch XMI-MSIM.

For Windows users: an entry should have been added to the Start menu. Navigate towards it in _Programs_ and click on _XMI-MSIM_.

For Linux users: an entry should have been added to the Education section of your Start menu. Since this may very considerably depending on the Linux flavour that is being used, this may not be obvious at first. Alternatively, fire up a terminal and type:

> `xmimsim-gui`

Your desktop should now be embellished with a window resembling the one in the following screenshot.
